# BetterVectorDrawable
The [VectorDrawable](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/drawable/VectorDrawable.html) implementation for Android 4.0+ (API level 14 or greater).

Alternative to the automatic generation of PNGs from vector drawables at build time by Android Plugin for Gradle 1.5.0+. The lib saves APK size and properly supports SVG’s fill rule (see [below](#paths-filltype-attribute)).

*Keywords: vector drawable, support library, compat, svg*

## Attaching the library
[![JCenter](https://img.shields.io/github/release/a-student/BetterVectorDrawable.svg)](#attaching-the-library)

The lib is deployed to the JCenter repository, so just add this line to the **build.gradle** *dependencies* section:
```groovy
compile 'com.bettervectordrawable:lib:0.7+'
```
In addition, you will need to disable automatic generation of PNGs at build time by adding `generatedDensities = []` line to the *defaultConfig* section:
```groovy
defaultConfig {
    generatedDensities = []
    …
}
```

## Usage
### Inflating
```java
Drawable drawable = VectorDrawableCompat.inflate(getResources(), R.drawable.your_vector);

// or if resource interception is enabled (see below for how to enable)
Drawable drawable = getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.your_vector);
```
There is an overload of the first method with a boolean parameter, which allows to force system handling of vector drawables on Android 5.0+.
However, using this overload is not recommended, because system implementation of VectorDrawable does not support some extra features, like path’s fillType attribute (see below).

The second method is advised to always use because it allows the system to cache the drawable and hence is more efficient.

### Referencing vector drawables from other XML resources
It is possible to reference vector drawables from other drawable or layout XML resources as regular drawables.
For this feature to work, you need to enable resource interception.

Extend the `Application` class and override the `onCreate()` method. Do not forget to modify **AndroidManifest.xml** accordingly (see the demo app).

Call
```java
VectorDrawableCompat.enableResourceInterceptionFor(getResources(), …);
```
from the onCreate method. The last parameter is a list of vector resource IDs for which interception must be enabled.

There are three ways to obtain the list. If you are not sure what way to choose, try to measure the performance of the each method.

#### Very convenient, but relatively slow
```java
int[] ids = VectorDrawableCompat.findAllVectorResourceIdsSlow(getResources(), R.drawable.class);
VectorDrawableCompat.enableResourceInterceptionFor(getResources(), ids);
```
This method scans through all drawable XML resources and ensures that each returned resource has vector data inside.
Usually it is OK to use this method by default. Nevertheless, it may increase application startup time on old devises if the app has many drawable resources of any type.

#### Less convenient, but faster
```java
int[] ids = VectorDrawableCompat.findVectorResourceIdsByConvention(getResources(), R.drawable.class, Convention.RESOURCE_NAME_HAS_VECTOR_SUFFIX);
VectorDrawableCompat.enableResourceInterceptionFor(getResources(), ids);
```
This method uses resource naming convention to find vector resources.
It relies on that every vector resource name matches `vector_*` pattern or `*_vector` pattern, or both. This can be controlled by the `resourceNamingConvention` parameter.

#### The fastest, but inconvenient
```java
VectorDrawableCompat.enableResourceInterceptionFor(getResources(),
    R.drawable.your1_vector,
    R.drawable.your2_vector,
    R.drawable.your3_vector);
```
Just enumerate vector drawable resource IDs manually.

## Converting SVGs to vector drawables
> When parsing XML resources, Android ignores XML attributes that aren’t supported by the current device.

This is why you have to duplicate unsupported `android:` attributes in the vector drawable XMLs. For example:
```xml
<vector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:better="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:width="100dp"
    android:height="100dp"
    android:viewportHeight="100"
    android:viewportWidth="100"
    better:viewportHeight="100"
    better:viewportWidth="100">
…
```
For a complete list of attributes, which must be duplicated, see [attrs.xml](lib/src/main/res/values/attrs.xml#L52)
(duplicate attributes do not have `android:` prefix).

To make it easier for you, use [SVG to VectorDrawable Converter](https://github.com/a-student/SvgToVectorDrawableConverter).

See section **BetterVectorDrawable library** there for the converter command, which produces vector drawables understandable by the lib.

## Converting vector drawable to Bitmap
The lib contains the util class that allows you to convert almost any drawable to a Bitmap. [Read more.](docs/BitmapUtil.md)

## Path’s fillType attribute
The lib additionally supports specifying `better:fillType` attribute on a path. This gives you ability to control how the inside of the path is determined.
It corresponds to the **fill-rule** attribute in SVG and accepts two values: `winding` (**nonzero** in SVG) and `even_odd` (**evenodd** in SVG).

## Issues
If you have any problems with the lib, please create an issue on GitHub (https://github.com/a-student/BetterVectorDrawable/issues/new)
and explain the reproducing steps.
